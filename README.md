# Water overflow and Rain Detector

The problem at hand is the potential risk of water overflow and the lack of an efficient rain monitoring system. Uncontrolled water overflow can lead to significant property damage, endangering lives and causing
financial losses. There may be areas where water leakage is a possibility, but we are not always able to keep an eye on them ourselves. If a water leak occurs abruptly, the furniture will be destroyed, and there is a danger that mold and mildew could form because of the water collection, which poses a health risk.

Another problem that most people experience is a malfunctioning floating valve that is used to detect tank overflow. Water bills will likely go up dramatically as a result of this potential water.

The discomfort of having outside clothing and furniture become wet from rain is another frequent issue that many people encounter. Everything that is left outside, including our outdoor furniture and cushions and clothing, might get unexpectedly dampened by rain and can get damaged.
